= Introduction =

This is at the moment a safe (and versioned :) ) place for a project developed for university, and a way for me to practice with svn. The software solve peg solitaire in 2 ways: one applying move one at a time (this is done in file psolitaire.py, you can execute it typing "python psolitaire.py"), the other applying "tiles", macro-moves that remove a bunch of peg at time (in file pegsolitaire.py).
If you are interested in peg solitaire problem or have some ideas/questions about this software contact me.
